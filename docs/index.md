## Introduction

5esheets is a **work in progress** <abbr title="Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition">D&D 5e</abbr> character sheet web-application that you can run yourself without any external system dependency (database, search engine, etc).

## What 5esheets is

5esheets is a character sheet manager. It allows players to keep track of their players, and dungeons masters to keep track of their players' character. It is aimed at providing a clearer layout than the [official character sheet](https://media.wizards.com/2022/dnd/downloads/DnD_5E_CharacterSheet_FormFillable.pdf), while giving players some flexibility in how their sheet is organized.

It is intended to be self-hostable, easy to back-up and manage.

## What 5esheets isn't

5esheets is _not_ a virtual tabletop, like [Foundry](https://foundryvtt.com/), [Fantasy Grounds](https://www.fantasygrounds.com) or [Roll20](https://roll20.net/). We have no plan to support maps, tokens, lightning effects, etc. We only want to provide a character sheet manager.
