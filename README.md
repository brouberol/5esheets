# D&D 5e character sheets

This is a small web application allowing anyone to visualize and update their D&D 5e character sheets in a web browser.
The data is saved in an sqlite database, and can thus be backed-up very quickly.

The sheet is heavily inspired by this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/6b8gv5/5e_character_sheet_with_pure_htmlcss/).
